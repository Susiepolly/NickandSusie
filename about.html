        <h2 id="head-us">About Us</h2>
        <p id="info-us">Nick and Susie, also known as Odd Shoes and Susie Qs, have been teaching and training lindy hop together since 2012. In 2015 they were some of the founding teachers of Corner Pocket Swing, Brisbane’s newest swing dance school. As part of Corner Pocket, Nick and Susie taught regular levels 1, 2 and 3, and various weekend workshops including Dance in a Day, higher level learning and aerials. In 2016 and again in 2017 they taught at the Australian national festival Swing Camp Oz. Over this time they competed and placed either together or individually in various competitions including the Australian Hellzapoppin’ Prize in 2014, the Paul Verervis Memorial Jack and Jill 2017, and The Australian Jiiterbug Championships - Fast and Furious division 2017. In 2017 they won the showcase division at the Australian Jitterbug Championships.<br><br>The duo have since moved to London, Susie in 2017 and Nick in 2018. Since then they have won Swing for the Crown in 2018, placed in multiple divisions at London Throwdown 2018 including a second place in the allstar strictly and a win in the allstar mix and match, and judged and competed in the invitational level at London Throwdown 2019. They are currently teaching for Swing Patrol London, running Brixton Bounce and teaching the advanced social dance troupe the Skyliners, and Susie is teaching swing patrol’s solo jazz classes.</p>

        <h2 id="head-susie">Susie Pembroke Wilson</h2>
        <p id="info-susie">Starting at just 3 years old, Susie has always has a passion for dance and performance. She has over 15 years of classical ballet & jazz training, has dabbled in tap, contemporary, hip hop and even belly dancing. As an adult Susie studied performance, dance and choreography in Brisbane, Australia, giving her a greater understanding of movement, art, and connection with audiences.<br><br>It was while at university that Susie took her first Lindy hop class in 2008. She has since travelled extensively to dance socially, and learn from the best international Lindy Hop instructors the world over. Susie has been teaching Lindy hop since 2012 and during this time has had the privilege to teach at national dance camp Swing Camp Oz, help launch a new dance school, work with some amazing international instructors and even win a couple of competitions.<br><br>Susie believes that classes can be fun while still instilling strong foundations and that there is no greater joy than really connecting with someone on the dance floor. In every class Susie strives to challenge and inspire her students whilst preserving the joyful spirit of Lindy hop.</p>

        <h2 id="head-nick">Nick Grant</h2>
        <p id="info-nick">It’s not everyday you meet someone who threw in a successful mining-geology career because they ‘just want to dance’ but that is exactly what Brisbane based dancer, Nicholas Grant did. Trading survey tools for his trademark ‘odd-shoes’ in 2012, Nick is now focused on instilling the same love of dance in people of all ages and all abilities. Nick brings invaluable practical experience to his classes- he has attended the world’s largest swing event in Herräng (Sweden) twice, he is an active member of the national and international swing scene and has been dancing at competition level since 2012.<br><br>Though Nick’s true passion remains with swing dancing – in-particular Lindy Hop, his affinity for all types of dance mean he brings a well-rounded and individual approach to his classes. Nick works on the philosophy that, partner dancing is simply communicating in different language and learning that language is a whole lot of fun.</p>
